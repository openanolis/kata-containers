# Introduction
`Dragonball Sandbox` is a light-weight virtual machine manager (VMM) based on Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM),
which is optimized for container workloads with:
- container image management and acceleration service
- flexible and high-performance virtual device drivers
- low CPU and memory overhead
- minimal startup time
- optimized concurrent startup speed

`Dragonball Sandbox` aims to provide a simple solution for the Kata Containers community. It is integrated into Kata 3.0
runtime as a built-in VMM and gives users an out-of-the-box Kata Containers experience without complex environment setup
and configuration process.
